                <p> <b class="highlight">Remote accessibility:</b></p> 
                <p></p>Virtual labs can be accessed remotely from anywhere with an internet connection. This accessibility eliminates constraints of physical infrastructure, allowing students to practice and learn at their own pace at any location. Additionally, it facilitates collaborative learning as students can access the lab simultaneously from different locations.

                <p>Visual representations in virtual labs can simplify complex structures. For example, displaying sorting algorithms step-by-step or demonstrating how different data structures handle data organization and retrieval visually helps learners comprehend the intricacies involved.  Virtual labs also incorporate interactive visualizations of data </p>

        <h2 class="depheading1">Bachelor of Technology</h2>
        <h3 class="depheading2">Computer Engineering | B.Tech (COMP)</h3>
        <p class="depinfo">
            Computer engineering program takes a look at the theories and technologies that underpin computers. The B.Tech in Computer engineering course is likely to teach technical skills such as programming and software design.This courses also tend to include the study of data and mathematical algorithms that are used by computers to process data. Successful computer engineering students will have an interest in both the hardware and software aspects of computers. 
            The department is accredited by NBA in 2018 and intake has doubled to 120 from academic year 2019-20. Besides offering undergraduate (B. Tech. in Computer Engineering) it also offers Post Graduation (M.Tech.) in Artificial Intelligence. As the autonomous status is awarded by UGC from academic year 2021-22, curricula have revised for UG and PG programs by Board of Studies. Exposure courses like Skill based, Activity based and Technology based courses are added to motivate students to participate in various activities. Under Project Based Learning (PBL) mini, minor and major projects are introduced from sem III to Sem VIII which help students to work in a team and develop projects using latest technologies.
